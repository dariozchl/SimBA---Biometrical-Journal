Supporting material for the submission "A novel approach to the design and sample size planning of animal experiments based on effect estimation" to Biometrical Journal. 

The file "app.R" is the code underlying the Shiny app available at https://dariozchl.shinyapps.io/. It is meant for demonstration purposes - due to computational effort, serious calculations of a design's operating characteristics require multi-core implementation. 

The file "simulation file - Biometrical Journal.R" contains the code used for the simulation study presented in the manuscript. It can also serve as template for an extensive individual simulation on a high-performance CPU or a cluster. The input parameters are easily modifiable to meet the requirements of an individual experiment.
